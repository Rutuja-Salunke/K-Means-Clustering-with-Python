Title: Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand - UCI Machine Learning Repository Project Using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview:

### Introduction:
With the growing popularity of social media platforms for e-commerce, Facebook Live has emerged as a powerful tool for sellers to connect with their audience in real-time. This project aims to analyze and categorize Facebook Live sellers in Thailand using machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering.

### Objectives:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather data from Facebook Live sessions of sellers in Thailand, including features such as viewer engagement, duration, product categories, and seller interaction.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure quality and consistency. Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering if necessary.

3. **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from the data to be used in the clustering process. This may include metrics such as the number of viewers, likes, comments, and product categories.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of various features, identify patterns, and understand the characteristics of Facebook Live seller sessions in Thailand.

5. **K-Means Clustering:** Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group Facebook Live sellers based on similar characteristics. Experiment with different values of K to find the optimal number of clusters.

6. **Cluster Analysis:** Analyze the clusters formed by K-Means to identify distinct seller profiles. Explore the commonalities and differences among sellers within each cluster.

7. **Visualization:** Visualize the results using appropriate charts and graphs to present the clustering outcomes and highlight key insights.

8. **Evaluation:** Assess the quality of the clustering results using internal validation metrics, such as silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index, to ensure the effectiveness of the chosen clustering approach.
### Tools and Technologies:
- Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and clustering.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, including K-Means clustering.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

### Expected Outcomes:
- Identified clusters of Facebook Live sellers in Thailand based on their session characteristics.
- Insights into the common traits and behaviors of sellers within each cluster.
- Visualization of the clustering results for easy interpretation.
- Recommendations for sellers, marketers, and platform administrators to enhance their Facebook Live strategies.
